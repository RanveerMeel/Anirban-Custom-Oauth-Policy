# This is an example of a Custom Policy Definition file.This policy is created by Anirban Sen Chowdhary
# This policy works with Mule oauth provider (https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/mule-secure-token-service) or custom Mule oauth provider
# This Custom Policy overcomes many limitations of Mule external oauth policy. This Custom Policy mainly helps in:
# - Access_Token can be passed to the API using all 3 ways: 1) Header 2) Query params 3) Authorization Header
# - It overcomes the limitation of default Mule oauth policy which use caching and unable to restrict invalid tokens or the token which has been revoked.
# - It has an added advantage of restricting particular Client or Client list as well as a particular Scope or list of Scopes.
